                6. PAYMENT CONFIRMATION: The customer receives a payment confirmation through the app.<br>

            </ul>
            <h3>SUBSCRIPTIONS PAYMENT </h3>
            <ul>
                        1. MERCHANT INTEGRATION: The third-party app integrates with the merchant'ssystem
                        (e.g., streaming service, software provider).<br>
                        2. SUBSCRIPTION SETUP: The customer sets up a subscription through the app.<br>
                        3. PAYMENT METHOD STORAGE: The customer's payment method is stored securely in the app.<br>

                Web2 utility industry have earned its status of being one of if not the best in the utility ecosystem,<br>
                 but allot of limitations surrounds them. Lets properly understand how Skull Ape ecosystem is coming to <br>

        <h3>INEFFICIENT PAYMENT PROCESSING </h3>
        <p>
            The Web2 billing, utility, and subscription industries faces significant<br>
             challenges in payment processing, including manual processing, delayed <br>
             payments, and high processing fees. These inefficiencies lead to increased<br> 
             costs, reduced customer satisfaction, and decreased revenue<br>
            These can be showed in the following Skull Ape mathematical algorithm:<br>
            Let's assume a payment processing system with a 2% transaction fee and a 3-day<br>
             settlement period.We can represent this using the following algorithm:<br>

            Payment Processing Fee 
            (PPF) = 0.02 * Transaction Value (TV)<br>
            Settlement Period (SP) = 3 days

            With Skull Ape ecosystem, we can reduce the TRANSACTION FEE and SETTLEMENT PERIOD <br>
            using the following mathematical algorithm:<br>
            Decentralized Payment <br>
            Processing Fee (DPPF) = 0.001 * TV<br>
            Decentralized Settlement <br>
            Period (DSP) = near real-time<br>

        <h3>SOLUTION: DECENTRALIZED PAYMENT PROCESSING </h3>
        <p>
            Skull Ape have a solution of Decentralized payment processing, enabled by Web3 and Blockchain technologies,<br>
            offers a solution to these challenges.<br>
            By utilizing Skull Ape ecosystem, businesses can facilitate efficient, low-cost transactions.<br>
            Smart contracts automate payment processing, reducing manual intervention and minimizing errors.<br>
            Decentralized payment networks enable real-time settlement, reducing delays and fees.<br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            We can represent Skull Ape decentralized payment processing system using the following algorithm:
            <br>
            <br>
            Decentralized Payment <br>
            Processing (DPP) <br>
            = DPPF + DSP <br>
            DPP = 0.001 * TV + near real-time

        <h3>BILLING ERRORS </h3>
        <p>Billing errors, including inaccurate invoices, late bills, and disputed charges, <br>
            are a significant challenge in the Web2 billing, utility, and subscription industries. <br>
            These errors lead to customer dissatisfaction, revenue leakage, and increased costs.<br>
            Skull Ape Mathematical Algorithm Explanation:
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's assume a billing system with a 2% error rate and an average invoice value of $100.<br>
            We can represent this using the following algorithm:<br>
            Billing Error Rate (BER) <br>
            = 0.02<br>
            Average Invoice Value <br>
            (AIV) = $100<br>
            <br>
            We can reduce the error rate using the following algorithm:
            <br>
            Decentralized Billing<br>
            Error Rate (DBER) = 0.001<br>
            Decentralized Average Invoice Value<br>

                Unidentified or uncollected revenue leads to reduced revenue growth and increased costs.<br>
                <br>
                Mathematical Algorithm Explanation:<br>
                <br>
                Let's assume a revenue leakage rate of 3% and an average monthly revenue of $100,000.<br>
                We can represent this using the following algorithm:<br>
                <br>
                Revenue Leakage Rate (RLR) = 0.03<br>
                Average Monthly Revenue (AMR) = $100,000<br>

                Average Cost per Breach (ACB)<br>
                = $100,000<br>
                <br>
                With Web3 and Blockchain, we can reduce the probability of data breaches using the following<br>
                 algorithm:
                Decentralized <br>
                Data Breach Probability (DDBP) = 0.01<br>
                Decentralized <br>
                Average Cost per Breach (DACB)<br>
                = $100,000<br>
